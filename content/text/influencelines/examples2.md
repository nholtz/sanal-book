Sometimes loads are applied to one part of a structure, but an influence
line is wanted for the resulting action in another part.  When using the 
Muller-Breslau principle to draw the influence line, it is important
to know that unit displacements are imposed at the appropriate part
of the structure where the response is desired, but it is the displaced
shape of the load-carrying portion that ves the influence line.

A common example is that of a bridge structure - the main load carrying
girders are parallel to the road direction and span between piers, but there may
be only two of these placed a considerable distance apart.  If the deck slab had
to span between the girders, it would be very thick and heavy.
So cross beams are placed at regular intervals.  Then stringers 
are placed close together, spanning between beams.  The slab then
only has to span between stringers and can be lighter as a result.

Wheel loads are transferred to the slab, then from the slab to the stringers, then from the stringers to the beams and finally from the beams to the girders
and then into the supports.

If you wish an influence line for an action, such as shear force in the girder,
you must displace the girder appropriately then draw the resulting displaced
shapes of the stringers.
