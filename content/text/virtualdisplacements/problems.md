### Problem 3

For the following frame, use the principle of virtual work (virtual displacement) to determine:

1. Vertical and horizontal reactions at point _b_.
1. Vertical and horizontal reactions at point _e_.
1. Bending moment at point _f_.
1. Bending moment at point _c_.
1. Shear force at point _f_.
1. Normal force at point _f_.
1. Shear force just to the right of point _b_.
1. Shear force just to the left of point _b_.
1. Shear force just above point _d_.
1. Axial (normal) force at point _d_.

In all cases, chose a virtual displacement that involves only the unknown force and the applied loads.
