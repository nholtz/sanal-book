# 2: Forces in Statically Determinate Beams and Plane Frames

## 2.1: Introduction

This chapter discusses issues of determinacy and stability, reviews
common techniques for determining the external reactions in beam and
plane frame structures, and develops the methods required to draw
complete axial force, shear force, bending moment diagrams from
statically determinate beams and plane frames.
