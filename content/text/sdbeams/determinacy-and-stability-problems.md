## 2.2.6: Problems - Stability and Determinacy

### Suggested Problems

For each of the following structures, determine whether it is stable
or not.  If the structure is stable, state the degree of
indeterminacy.  Click on the link to see the solution.

**Problem 12**

For the above problem (Problem 11), if it is unstable, can you arrange the
four roller supports so that it becomes stable?  If so, show the new
arrangement and state the determinacy of the resulting structure.
