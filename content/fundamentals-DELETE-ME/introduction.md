# 1: Fundamental Concepts

## 1.1: Introduction

To perform a structural analysis means to determine all of the forces
and displacements that act on and within a structural assembly such as
a building frame or a truss.  In reality, of course, the structural
engineer creates a mathematical model that approximates a real
structure, and performs an analysis of that model.

The act of creating the model is very important, but is largely beyond
the scope of this course -- left for the time when a student has a
better grasp of material behaviour and construction techniques.  In
this course, we will largely provide you with models, without comment.

To have the ability to perform a structural analysis requires that you
have a very good grasp of the following sets of concepts:

* Equilibrium
* Boundary Conditions: Constraints and Internal Conditions
* Elasticity (force/displacement relationships)
* Compatibility (of displacements)

All structures must satisfy all the requirements implied in the above,
so these are a set of mathematical tools we can use to determine
initially unknown quantities in our models.  In fact, this list is
sometimes reduced to three concepts: 

* *Equilibrium*, which says
something about the required relationships within a set of forces;
* *Compatibility*, which says something about the required relationships
within a set of displacements; and 
* *Elasticity*, which relates forces
to displacements. 

We will explicitly include *boundary conditions* as a part of *compatibility*
and will discuss the four areas separately.  We note here that we do
not always have to use all tools for all structures -- that will be
clear later.

In addition, there are a small set of other tools that we use to
assist us in our mathematics, and that are also fundamental:

* Free Body Diagrams
* Small Displacement Theory (both rigid body and elastic)

We will cover these in the order that we encounter their need as we
progress through different kinds of problems, starting with *equilibrium*
(next page).
