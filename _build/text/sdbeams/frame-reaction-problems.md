# 2: Forces in Statically Determinate Beams and Plane Frames

## 2.7: External Reactions in Frames

### 2.7-P: Problem Set

**Suggested Problems**

For each of the following frames:
- compute all reactions and show on a summary FBD of the whole structure.
- draw complete FBDs of each structural member, showing numeric values 
  for all important internal forces.
- determine the internal member forces at the locations marked 
  (with an '*') and show that joint equilibrium is satisfied.
