# 2: Forces in Statically Determinate Beams and Plane Frames

## 2.9: Internal Forces in Frames

### 2.9-P1: Worked Examples

Worked examples from class, Fall 2011.

1. [Example F1](../../images/sdbeams/probs-frame-nvm/Example-F1.pdf)

1. [Example F2](../../images/sdbeams/probs-frame-nvm/Example-F2.pdf)

### 2.9-P2 Suggested Problems

For each of the frames shown:

* calculate the reactions (both external and the 
  forces on any internal pins).
* show all reactions on appropriate FBDs.
* thoroughly inspect the FBD and confirm that various 
  combinations of applied forces are in equilibrium.
* show that every joint is in equilibrium.
* draw normal force, shear forces, and bending moment diagrams, 
  clearly labelling the key values and showing the directions of all 
	  internal forces.
