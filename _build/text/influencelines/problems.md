# 5. Influence Lines

## 5.3 Suggested Problems

### Problem 5.3-01

![Figure](../../images/influencelines/suggested-problems/problem-01-beam.svg)

Sketch influence lines for the following effects:

1. Moment at $a$.
1. Moment at $b$.
1. Shear at $b$.
1. Shear at $c$.
1. Shear just to the left of $d$.
1. Shear just to the right of $d$.
1. Moment at d.
1. Shear at $e$.
1. Shear just to the left of $f$.
1. Shear just to the right of $f$.
1. Moment at $f$.

The structure is subjected to a uniform _live load_ of 20kN/m
and a concentrated _live load_ of 60kN (acting simultaneously).
Determine the range of each effect for this loading condition.
Show the correwsponding position of the loads, for each.
