# Structural Analysis

This is a 'proof-of-concept' for using a
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html "Jupyter Book Site")
to create a set of course notes to support the teaching of
[CIVE 3203: Introduction to Structural Analysis](https://calendar.carleton.ca/search/?P=CIVE%203203)
in the 
[Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://carleton.ca/cee/)
at
[Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/).

## See the sample book:

The book is available at: **[https://nholtz.github.io/sanal-book/index](https://nholtz.github.io/sanal-book/index)**

This is intended to be a *teaching tool*, to teach students how to solve
the particular problems.  It is not intended to be an engineering design
tool or computational aid, nor is it intended to teach students how to program.

## Possibly Useful Features:

* Reasonably easy to build pages containing images, drawings, mathematics
and executable code,
using [JupyterLab Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html).
* Possibility of providing interactive pages for problem solution exploration
using Jupyter notebooks and Python programming.
* Jupyter Book does a reasonably good job of building a multi-page website
with nice navigational tools.
* maybe some others that I'll think of later ...
